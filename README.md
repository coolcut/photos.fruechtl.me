## How to use Photon?

Photon has two simple rules:

1. You need to put all images inside the `/uploads` directory.
2. To show these images on your website, you need to create a markdown file inside the `/posts` directory. This markdown file handles everything from referencing the image you want to show to handling additional metadata for this specific post.

A post looks like this:

```
---
layout: layouts/photo.njk
date: 2020-03-01
caption: Test 1
imageSource: andy-feliciotti-YNkjiFhMtck-unsplash.jpg
imageAlt: This is the alt text
---
```

- `layout`: Don't change this! This is the template your photo will be render in.
- `date`: This is the published date of this post. You can set it to everything you want, but please stick to the formatting (YEAR-MONTH-DAY)
- `caption`: A simple caption for your image
- `imageSource`: Reference the file name of the photo you want to reference. Photo looks inside `/uploads` to find it.
- `imageAlt`: Add a simple alternative text describing the image. This can help people who depend on assistive technologies like screen reader.

## Customize

- `language`: Add the HTML language code to tell the primary language you are using on your site to the browser. Default `en`
- `title`: Give your site a proper title
- `url`: Enter the URL your site is going to live on
- `slogan`: Give your site a quick summary. This will be available on your homepage.
- `favicon`: Customise your favicon with an emoji
- `author.name`: Add your name here
- `author.email`: Add your email address here, so people can contact you if you want
- `seo.title`: Add a SEO title here. Used on the homepage.
- `seo.description`: Add a SEO description here. Used on the homepage.
- `social.twitter`: If you want to link to your twitter account, add it here. A reference will be displayed in the homepage.
